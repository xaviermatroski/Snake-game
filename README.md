# Snake Game
A classic Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library.

## Description
This project is a simple implementation of the Snake game, where the player controls a snake that grows longer as it consumes food. The game features a graphical user interface (GUI) created with the Turtle library. I have implemented this program using several classes.

## Features
  - Snake movement using arrow keys
  - Food tiles (white squares) that appear randomly on the screen
  - Score display at the top of the screen
  - High score stored in data.txt
  - After losing the game restarts on its own
  - To abandon the game cancel the turtle GUI

## Installation
  - Clone this repository to your local machine.
  - Make sure you have Python installed.
  - Run the game using the following command:
  - python snake.py

## Controls
  - Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake.
  - Collect the white food tiles to increase your score.

The high score is stored in the data.txt file.
